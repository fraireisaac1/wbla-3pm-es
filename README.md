# Elevate

## WBLA Team Project, Equipo Siete
During the beginning second semester of my first year at the West-Mec Coding technical program, our class was tasked with creating multiple websites pertaining to the requests of WBLA. This was to be a learning experience for us students so that we'd know how it felt to work in teams. The website that our group was assigned to design was called Elevate, a weight training and excersise equipment e-commerce site. Our team was the seventh team assigned a project, thus, we dubbed ourselves Equipo Siete.

## Purpose
The site was designed to be an e-commerce site for weight training and exercise equipment. Therefore, the site is designed and structured in a way that lets a user scroll through a plethora of virtual products and purchase them. Aside from the basic functionality of the website, the purpose of the project itself was to measure how effective our teamwork skills were. Our ability to collaborate effectively made it so that we completed the project efficiently and competently.

## Technologies Used and Why
* JavaScript: This was the coding language most of the semester was coded in. To ensure that we had proper knowledge of the language, this project was assigned to us. Mind you, this was in the first semester of West-Mec, before us students learned anything about databases and CRUD commands. Therefore, all of the functionality in the project is made with bare-bones JavaScript. If we re-did the project today, we certainly would have used something like SQL or MongoDB to store the data and Express to handle the CRUD operators. It's really quite impressive what we were able to do with vanilla JavaScript and local/session storage, since the project is still completely functional and surprisingly intuitive for first year coding students.
* Node.js: The technology used to execute the JavaScript code outside of a web browser. We coded the whole project with Visual Studio Code, so Node.js was necessary to use in order to get the project running from the console to the browser.
* GIMP 2.10.34: We used Gimp so that we could properly edit the pictures we used in the website. Most of the pictures needed altering in order to render properly on the web pages, so Gimp was a very usefull tool in that regard to edit whatever pictures we needed to display.
