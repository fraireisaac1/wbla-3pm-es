# Elevate

## WBLA Team Project, Equipo Siete
During the beginning second semester of my first year at the West-Mec Coding technical program, our class was tasked with creating multiple websites pertaining to the requests of WBLA. This was to be a learning experience for us students so that we'd know how it felt to work in teams. The website that our group was assigned to design was called Elevate, a weight training and excersise equipment e-commerce site.

## Purpose
The site was designed to be an e-commerce site for weight training and exercise equipment. Therefore, the site is designed and structured in a way that lets a user scroll through a plethora of virtual products and purchase them.
